# Development Log — Greenhouse Deleafing Benchmark

Goal: an Isaac Sim benchmark for evaluating VLAs on tomato **deleafing** (removing
orphan/lower leaves from high-wire vines), targeting demo collection → π0.5
finetuning → deployment on the Rainbow Robotics **RB-Y1** (sim and real).

Environment: Isaac Sim **5.1.0-rc.19** (Kit 107.3.3, omni.physx 107.3.26, USD 0.24.5)
at `D:\isaac-sim`, Windows 11. Branch `koh-dev/simulator-base` (fork of openpi).

## Status

- [x] Recon: assets, Isaac 5.1 APIs, RB-Y1 SDK, repo conventions, prior art
- [x] Verified: Isaac Sim launches headless; greenhouse stage opens (7667 prims,
      3433 meshes); `breakForce`/`breakTorque`/`excludeFromArticulation` author OK
- [x] Verified: fused vine GLBs decompose into per-organ connected components
- [x] Asset pipeline: GLB → organ graph → structured USD (all 20 vines)
- [x] Greenhouse composition + launch (renders headless; see below)
- [ ] Compliant vine physics (bend/droop)
- [ ] Cut + pull severance
- [ ] RB-Y1 URDF v1.0 integration
- [ ] Benchmark task definition + metrics

## Findings

### Vine assets — `greenhouse/tomato_glb_20/` (2026-08-06)

20 vines, `tomato_XXX.glb` + `tomato_XXX.json` sidecar. Metadata gives units (m),
height, organ counts, and an **attachment graph**: `SubStem_XX` / `Truss_XX` /
`Fruit_XX` / `Flower_XX` with parent + 3D attach point.

The GLB itself is **one node, one mesh, no hierarchy** — organs are fused and split
only by material (`TomatoStem`, leaf `Material.0xx`, `FruitRipe_r_c`). No skins,
animations, or morph targets. ~528–557k verts / 755–791k tris per vine, of which
the stem material is ~83% of triangles.

Critically, **connected-component analysis recovers the organs** (tomato_000):

| Material class | Components | Interpretation |
|---|---|---|
| `TomatoStem` | 121 | 1 main stem (118,560 tris, full height) + 120 laterals |
| leaf materials | 113 | 109 leaf blades (~895 tris each) + 4 flowers (~5.4k) |
| `FruitRipe_*` | 8 | 5 fruits (body + calyx parts) |

Component counts match the metadata exactly (`leaves: 109`, `flowers: 4`,
`fruits: 5`). A radial profile of the main-stem component shows r99 ≈ r50 above
0.5 m, i.e. it is a clean tube with **no laterals fused into it** — so laterals are
genuinely separable. A nearest-neighbour proximity graph over components yields
~25 direct children of the main stem (vs 18 sub-stems + 3 trusses expected) and
chains up to depth 8 (petiole → petiolule → leaflet).

Coordinates: glTF is **Y-up**, metadata is Blender **Z-up**; the mapping
`(x, y, z)_meta → (x, z, −y)_glTF` was verified by landing `Fruit_00`'s attach
point on that fruit's bounding-box centre.

**Anatomy note.** 18 sub-stems and 109 leaves means `SubStem_XX` is the **petiole of
a compound leaf** and the 109 "leaves" are its leaflets. The 18 sub-stems are
therefore the deleafing targets, and each sub-stem's attach point on the main stem
is the agronomically correct (flush) cut site.

### Greenhouse stage — `greenhouse/green_house.usd`

Z-up, meters, `defaultPrim=/World`. Two cultivation zones (`Main_Cultivation_Zone`,
`..._01` offset +24.9 m in Y), each with 4 bed rows = **256 BedSet groups**. Each
BedSet payloads `objects/Bed.usd` + 4 pipes and owns a local `Strings/Cylinder_0X`
group of 6 trellis strings — the natural anchor points for vines.

Physics present: only 3 ground `Plane` prims with `PhysicsCollisionAPI`. **No
PhysicsScene, no rigid bodies, no colliders** on beds/pipes/walls. No cameras. No
tomato stems referenced into the stage yet.

Object USDs are Y-up/cm and are brought in via payload arcs with auto-inserted
`unitsResolve` xform ops (rotateX 90, scale 0.01).

### Isaac Sim 5.1 physics capabilities

- **No topological cutting of deformables exists**, and NVIDIA's own guidance is to
  fake it by pre-splitting geometry and disabling attachments (IsaacSim issue #258
  closed without a feature). Attachments have **no break force** and can be added
  but never deleted at runtime.
- **Newton is not in 5.1 at all** — it arrives with Isaac Sim 6.0. No `newton`
  package or extension is installed.
- FEM deformables are disqualified as the benchmark substrate: no static friction
  (grippers slip), OOM around 256 trivial bodies, no break threshold, and
  undocumented GPU determinism.
- `physics:breakForce` is **silently ignored on articulation joints** — breakable
  joints must be maximal-coordinate.

## Decisions

### D1 — Vine physics: compliant articulated capsule chains, not FEM

Model each organ as a chain of rigid capsule links joined by compliant D6 joints
with angular drive stiffness from Euler–Bernoulli beam theory (`Kp = E·I/ℓ`,
`I = πr⁴/4`, `Kd = 0.1·Kp`), following OrchardBench. This delivers the bending,
droop, and pull compliance the task needs while staying deterministic and fast.

Rationale: the user's requirement is *deformable behaviour* (bend, pull, cut), not
the FEM solver specifically. FEM in Isaac 5.1 cannot cut, cannot hold a grasp
(no static friction), and caps scale at tens of environments — all fatal for a
data-collection benchmark. Compliant chains give the same observable physics.
FEM is kept only as an optional visual/validation comparison.

### D2 — Cut primitive: in-place joint release, outside any articulation

Sever by releasing the petiole's base joint (zeroing drive gains and freeing the
constraint) when the tool's blade plane intersects the link and the jaws close;
`breakForce` on the same joint provides tensile **tear** when the policy pulls
instead of cuts, which distinguishes clean cut from tear as a metric. The whole
plant stays out of any `PhysicsArticulationRootAPI` subtree so `breakForce` is
honoured. Never delete prims at runtime — deactivate.

Stub length stays continuous (not quantised by link resolution) by measuring the
blade plane against the parent stem surface geometrically and shrinking the
parent-side capsule to the cut plane.

### D3 — Asset pipeline: hybrid proximity graph + generator metadata

Segment each GLB into organ components, build a parent graph by closest-approach,
then label the primary laterals with the generator's `SubStem`/`Truss` attach
points. Metadata is authoritative for semantics and cut sites; the graph is
authoritative for which geometry detaches together. Validation invariant: every
leaf blade maps to exactly one sub-stem, and per-vine totals match the sidecar
counts.

### D4 — Code layout: `examples/greenhouse_sim/`, per repo convention

openpi examples are self-contained clients with their own interpreter that talk to
`scripts/serve_policy.py` over websocket (libero runs Python 3.8 against a 3.11
main env). The sim therefore runs inside **Isaac Sim's bundled Python** with
`openpi-client` pip-installed into it; Isaac deps never enter the root
`pyproject.toml`. RB-Y1 SDK is vendored as a `third_party/` submodule per
`.gitmodules` convention. Generated USD goes to gitignored `data/`.

Offline asset tooling depends only on packages already present in Isaac's bundled
Python (numpy 1.26, scipy 1.15, pytest 9, plus `pxr` for USD authoring), so the
pipeline is reproducible from a bare Isaac install with nothing pip-installed.

### D5 — Headline metric: residual petiole stub length

No existing plant-manipulation benchmark measures it, and it is agronomically
decisive: flush pruning wounds are near-absolutely resistant to *Botrytis cinerea*
while petiole stubs are highly susceptible (Beyers et al. 2014), with lesions
advancing 0.3–0.5 cm/day. Bins: ≤5 mm flush / 5–20 mm marginal / >20 mm risk.

## Validation

### Organ segmentation, all 20 vines (2026-08-06)

Sub-stem, truss, and foliage counts match the metadata sidecar **exactly on every
vine**; no foliage organ fails to trace to a primary lateral; the adjacency search
reaches every stem organ, so the graft-onto-root fallback never fires. Junction
gaps are 0.3 mm median / ~5 mm p95 / 9.9 mm max against a 10 mm adjacency radius.
Runtime ≈ 1.8 s per vine.

Sub-stem labels are **monotonic in height on all 20 vines**, matching the
metadata's own ordering — which is what the bottom-up "remove the lowest leaves"
rule depends on.

The assigned junctions sit a systematic **+28 mm above** and ~7 mm lateral of the
metadata attach points. This is expected rather than an error: the generator
records attach points on the main-stem **centreline**, while segmentation computes
the **surface contact** where the two organs actually meet. The horizontal offset
matches the main-stem radius. Surface contact is the correct reference for
residual stub length (D5), so the computed junction is the one to keep.

Risk: the worst junction gap (9.9 mm) is close to the 10 mm adjacency radius. A
future asset generation with looser junctions could silently fall back to
grafting. `convert_vines_to_usd.py` now asserts every one of these invariants
and exits non-zero, so this cannot regress unnoticed.

### Scene composition (2026-08-06)

Greenhouse layout as measured, not assumed: beds are 5 m troughs whose planting
surface is at **Z = 0.888 m**, spaced 5.7 m apart, with two 5 m trellis strings
at each bed's ends (not per-plant strings). 256 BedSets across two zones.

Vines compose in at 0.25 m in-row spacing with seeded yaw jitter, and organ
prims stay addressable through the reference
(`/World/Vines/Vine_0000/MainStem/SubStem_06`), with materials bound. A headless
render confirms textured foliage, fruit trusses, and plants seated in the gutter.

**Asset defect found and worked around**: the greenhouse `DomeLight` references
`/home/jhlee/Desktop/...`, an absolute path from the machine the asset was
authored on. It fails to load on any other machine and leaves lighting to a
renderer fallback — unacceptable variation for a vision benchmark. The scene
layer now clears unresolvable light textures, leaving a uniform sky at the
authored colour and intensity. Worth fixing in the source asset too.

Open question for later: the source vines lean substantially (canopy extends
~0.75 m to one side). Real high-wire tomato is trained near-vertical up a string
and only leaned along the wire. Whether to correct this at placement time is a
fidelity decision that should be made deliberately, not by accident.

## Novelty position

Nearest neighbour is **OrchardBench** (GPU-parallel apple orchard, compliant
branches, fruit detachment). Differentiators, all of which must be delivered:
severance/cut quality rather than fruit pull-off, bimanual whole-body mobile
manipulation on RB-Y1, language-conditioned VLA evaluation, and real-robot
deployment (which OrchardBench explicitly disclaims).
